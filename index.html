            <h4 class="infom">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe ancient Egyptians have influenced much of modern history, they have started and created many things that have remained thousands of years later in our modern world. The Egyptians had advanced calendars, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, writing, and many more things. Without the Egyptians we would not have as many things as we do today, sadly much of original Egyptian knowledge has been lost with the thousands of years of foreign rule. But recently we have found much more things about ancient egyptians that show much more about how they have influenced the modern world.</h4>

            <h4 class="infoar">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe ancient Egyptians are well renowned for their engineering and architectural prowess. Their structures are meant to symbolize the connection between god, the king, and humanities, and not only that the structures were also meant to symbolize the perfection at the creation of the world by the gods, this architecture caused it to not be changed for thousands of years.. This construction is also emphasized in that fact that the pyramids at Giza are aligned towards the north indestructible stars. Their architecture has come into modern time with big buildings showing power and perfection, the Egyptians started the power and perfection construction technique. Not only that, their long lasting construction styles are like and most likely influenced, our government buildings, and religious buildings which have not changed much over thousands of years.
