            <h4 class="infom">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe ancient Egyptians have influenced much of modern history, they have started and created many things that have remained thousands of years later in our modern world. The Egyptians had advanced calendars, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, writing, and many more things. Without the Egyptians we would not have as many things as we do today, sadly much of original Egyptian knowledge has been lost with the thousands of years of foreign rule. But recently we have found much more things about ancient egyptians that show much more about how they have influenced the modern world.</h4>
